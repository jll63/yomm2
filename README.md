# YOMM2

YOMM2 was a library that implemented fast, open, multi-methods for C++17. It is
was inspired by the papers by Peter Pirkelbauer, Yuriy Solodkyy, and Bjarne
Stroustrup. The original README is [here](ORIGINAL-README.md).

YOMM2 has been superseded by
[Boost.OpenMethod](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/latest/libs/openmethod/doc/html/openmethod/index.html)
- an official Boost library.

Porting from YOMM2 to OpenMethod is easy - see below a copy of my announcement
